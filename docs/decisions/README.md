# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records that apply across multiple labs or to the repository structure itself.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records document important architectural decisions, the context in which they were made, and the consequences. They help:

- Understand why decisions were made
- Avoid revisiting already-decided issues
- Onboard new team members
- Maintain consistency across labs

## ADR Format

See the template in `labs/_template/decisions/0001-example-decision.md` for the standard format.

## ADR Index

| Number | Title | Status | Date |
|--------|-------|--------|------|
| [To be populated as ADRs are added] | | | |

## Creating New ADRs

1. Use the template from `labs/_template/decisions/`
2. Number sequentially (e.g., 0002, 0003)
3. Use descriptive kebab-case filenames
4. Update this README with the new ADR
