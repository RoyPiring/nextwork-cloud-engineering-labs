# Data Engineering Analytics Engineering

**Domain:** Data Engineering & Analytics

This engineering domain demonstrates data engineering workflows using Model Context Protocol (MCP) for database interaction, analysis, and optimization. Focuses on data pipeline design and query performance tuning.

## Domain Overview

This domain tells the story of building production-ready data engineering solutions following principal engineering methodology. We progress from foundational database setup to advanced optimization and production patterns, documenting each decision and its impact on performance, cost, and maintainability.

## Navigation

- **[Business Context](./business-context.md)** - Problem statement, requirements, and constraints
- **[Architecture](./architecture.md)** - System design, components, and integration patterns
- **[Implementation](./implementation.md)** - Step-by-step implementation guide

## Executions

The `executions/` directory contains detailed guides for specific data engineering implementations.

## Principal Engineering Decisions

1. **Database Selection:** Containerized vs. managed database for development
2. **Data Pipeline:** ETL vs. ELT vs. streaming patterns
3. **Query Optimization:** Indexing strategy and performance tuning
4. **Production Patterns:** Monitoring, reliability, and scalability considerations
5. **Cost Optimization:** Right-sizing data processing resources
