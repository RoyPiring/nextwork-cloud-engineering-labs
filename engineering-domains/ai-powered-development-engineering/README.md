# AI-Powered Development Engineering

**Domain:** Developer Productivity & Tooling

This engineering domain covers AI-powered development environments and tooling to enhance productivity in cloud engineering work. Demonstrates modern development workflows and developer productivity tools.

## Domain Overview

This domain tells the story of enhancing developer productivity through AI-powered tooling following principal engineering methodology. We progress from basic AI-assisted coding to advanced MCP integration, documenting how AI tools integrate into professional development workflows.

## Navigation

- **[Business Context](./business-context.md)** - Problem statement, requirements, and constraints
- **[Architecture](./architecture.md)** - System design, components, and integration patterns
- **[Implementation](./implementation.md)** - Step-by-step implementation guide
- **[Validation](./validation.md)** - Testing, verification, and success criteria
- **[Executions](./executions/)** - Detailed execution guides for specific development tooling patterns

## Executions

The `executions/` directory contains detailed guides for specific AI-powered development implementations.

## Principal Engineering Decisions

1. **IDE Selection:** AI-assisted IDE vs. traditional IDE tradeoffs
2. **AI Assistant Strategy:** Multiple AI assistants vs. single tool strategy
3. **MCP Integration:** Model Context Protocol for enhanced AI tooling
4. **Workflow Optimization:** Integrating AI tools into development workflows
5. **Productivity vs. Cost:** Balancing AI tool costs with productivity gains
