# Conversational AI Engineering

**Domain:** Conversational AI Applications

This engineering domain demonstrates complete implementation of conversational AI using Amazon Lex, from bot creation to advanced multi-turn conversations. Shows how managed NLP services can be used to build production-ready conversational interfaces.

## Domain Overview

This domain tells the story of building a production-ready conversational AI application following principal engineering methodology. We progress from understanding NLP fundamentals to deploying advanced multi-turn conversation systems, documenting each decision and its impact on user experience and system reliability.
