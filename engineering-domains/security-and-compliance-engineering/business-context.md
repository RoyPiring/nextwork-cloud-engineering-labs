# Business Context: Security and Compliance Engineering

## Problem Statement

Cloud environments require comprehensive security controls to protect data, applications, and infrastructure from threats while meeting compliance requirements. Manual security processes are error-prone and don't scale.

## Business Requirements

### Core Requirements

1. **Identity and Access Management:** Least-privilege access controls
2. **Data Protection:** Encryption at rest and in transit
3. **Secrets Management:** Secure credential storage and rotation
4. **Threat Detection:** Automated security threat detection
5. **Compliance:** Regulatory compliance validation and reporting

### Functional Requirements

- IAM roles, users, and policies
- Key management and encryption
- Secrets storage and rotation
- Security monitoring and alerting
- Compliance validation and audit logging

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security:** Defense-in-depth, least privilege, encryption
- **Reliability:** High availability security services
- **Performance:** Minimal impact on application performance
- **Maintainability:** Clear security policies and documentation
- **Cost:** Right-sized security services

## Constraints

- AWS service limits and quotas
- Compliance and regulatory requirements
- Budget constraints for security services
- Integration with existing systems

## Success Criteria

- Least-privilege access enforced
- Data encrypted at rest and in transit
- Secrets managed securely with rotation
- Threats detected and responded to automatically
- Compliance requirements met
