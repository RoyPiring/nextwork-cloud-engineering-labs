# RAG Applications Engineering

**Domain:** Knowledge-Grounded AI Applications

This engineering domain demonstrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) implementations for building knowledge-grounded AI applications using Amazon Bedrock. Shows how to combine document retrieval with foundation model inference to produce accurate, context-aware responses.

## Domain Overview

This domain tells the story of building knowledge-grounded AI applications following principal engineering methodology. We progress from setting up the knowledge base foundation to deploying complete RAG applications, documenting each architectural decision and its impact on accuracy, cost, and user experience.
