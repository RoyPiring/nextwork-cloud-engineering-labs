## I'm building database solutions on AWS

This project set focuses on building and evaluating managed database services on AWS. The scope covers relational and NoSQL database models and how they are applied within cloud-native architectures. The intent is to understand service selection, operational boundaries, and managed scaling characteristics rather than database internals. The work results in a set of discrete implementations suitable for portfolio review.

## Excited to share my progress - explore AWS databases with me!

This section documents the decision to publish progress artifacts as the projects are completed. Time allocation and task tracking are used only as execution controls, not as part of the system design. The outcome is a completed set of database-focused implementations that demonstrate familiarity with AWS-managed data services and their role in application architectures. 

### What are databases?

Databases provide structured and unstructured data storage with defined access patterns and consistency guarantees. In cloud environments, managed databases abstract infrastructure management while enabling scalability, durability, and availability aligned to application requirements. They support transactional workloads, real-time access, analytics, and integrity constraints depending on the chosen data model.

### What do database professionals do?

Database professionals design and operate data storage systems that balance performance, reliability, security, and cost. Responsibilities include schema and access pattern design, service selection, availability planning, performance tuning, security controls, and operational troubleshooting. The role centers on aligning data systems with application behavior and organizational constraints rather than managing individual queries or records.
