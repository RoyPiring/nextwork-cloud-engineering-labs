# Database Services Engineering

**Domain:** Data Layer Architecture

This engineering domain covers managed database services on AWS, from NoSQL to relational databases, with hands-on implementation and optimization. Demonstrates data layer architecture and performance tuning.

## Domain Overview

This domain tells the story of selecting, designing, and optimizing database solutions following principal engineering methodology. We progress from understanding database fundamentals to implementing production-ready data architectures with documented tradeoffs.

## Navigation

- **[Business Context](./business-context.md)** - Problem statement, requirements, and constraints
- **[Architecture](./architecture.md)** - System design, components, and integration patterns
- **[Implementation](./implementation.md)** - Step-by-step implementation guide
- **[Validation](./validation.md)** - Testing, verification, and success criteria
- **[Executions](./executions/)** - Detailed execution guides for specific database patterns

## Executions

The `executions/` directory contains detailed guides for specific database implementations.

## Principal Engineering Decisions

1. **Database Type:** NoSQL vs. relational selection criteria
2. **Data Modeling:** Partition key design and access patterns
3. **Scaling Strategy:** Provisioned vs. on-demand capacity
4. **High Availability:** Multi-AZ vs. global replication
5. **Cost Optimization:** Right-sizing and query optimization

## Prerequisites

- AWS account setup and fundamentals
- Basic understanding of database concepts
