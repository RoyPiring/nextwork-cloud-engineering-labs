# Single-Scope Engineering

**Domain:** Standalone Labs & Prerequisites

This engineering domain contains standalone labs and prerequisite content that can be used independently or integrated into other engineering domains. These are focused, single-scope implementations that don't require a full series progression.

## Domain Overview

Single-scope labs are self-contained implementations that focus on specific tools, services, or concepts. They can be completed independently and are often used as prerequisites or supporting resources for other engineering domains.

## Navigation

- **[Executions](./executions/)** - Standalone lab execution guides

## Executions

The `executions/` directory contains standalone lab implementations:

### Prerequisites
1. **[AWS Account Setup](./executions/aws-account-setup.md)** - AWS account setup and configuration
2. **[AWS Beginners Challenge](./executions/aws-beginners-challenge.md)** - Beginner-friendly AWS challenge

### AI/ML Tools
3. **[AI Agent No-Code](./executions/ai-agent-nocode.md)** - No-code AI agent implementation
4. **[AI Agent WebUI](./executions/ai-agent-webui.md)** - Web UI for AI agents
5. **[AI LLM DeepSeek](./executions/ai-llm-deepseek.md)** - DeepSeek LLM integration
6. **[AI Prompt Engineering](./executions/ai-promptengineering.md)** - Prompt engineering techniques
7. **[AWS AI Transcribe](./executions/aws-ai-transcribe.md)** - Amazon Transcribe implementation

### Storage

9. **[AWS Multi-Cloud Storage](./executions/aws-multicloud-storage.md)** - Multi-cloud storage strategies

## Usage

These labs can be:
- **Completed independently** without following a series
- **Used as prerequisites** before starting engineering domains
- **Integrated into projects** from other domains
- **Referenced as quick guides** for specific tools or patterns

## Prerequisites

- AWS account (for AWS-related labs)
- Basic understanding of cloud computing concepts
