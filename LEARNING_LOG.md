# Learning Log

This document tracks key learnings, insights, and patterns discovered through hands-on implementation work.

## Purpose

The learning log captures:
- Patterns and practices discovered through implementation
- Lessons learned from real-world scenarios
- Insights that inform future decisions
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

## How to Use

When you discover something valuable during implementation:
1. Document it here with context
2. Include the engineering domain or feature project
3. Note the date and any relevant links
4. Update related documentation if needed
