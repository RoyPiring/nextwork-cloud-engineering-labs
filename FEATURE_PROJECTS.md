# Feature Projects

Feature projects are comprehensive, end-to-end implementations that demonstrate principal engineering capabilities across multiple engineering domains. These projects showcase production-ready solutions with documented tradeoffs, validated implementations, and real-world applicability.

## What are Feature Projects?

Feature projects are complete, production-ready implementations that:
- Integrate multiple engineering domains
- Demonstrate principal engineering decision-making
- Include comprehensive documentation (business context, architecture, implementation, validation, tradeoffs)
- Showcase real-world problem-solving
- Serve as reference implementations

## Current Feature Projects

**Description:** Secure VPC architecture with compliance controls  
**Domains:** VPC Networking Engineering, Security and Compliance Engineering  
**Key Features:**
- Network isolation and segmentation
- Security boundary enforcement
- Compliance validation
- End-to-end security architecture

### fp-cost-optimization-observability
**Status:** [Status]  
**Description:** Cost-optimized infrastructure with comprehensive observability  
**Domains:** Observability and Cost Engineering, Application Architecture Engineering  
**Key Features:**
- Cost optimization strategies
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Right-sizing validation
- Cost anomaly detection

## Feature Project Structure

Each feature project follows this structure:

```
feature-projects/fp-[project-name]/
├── README.md                 # Reading order + summary
├── business-context.md       # Problem statement and requirements
├── architecture.md           # System design and components
├── implementation.md         # Step-by-step implementation
├── validation.md             # Testing and verification
├── tradeoffs.md              # Documented tradeoffs and decisions
└── images/                   # Architecture diagrams and visuals
    └── end-to-end-system.png
```

## Creating a New Feature Project

1. Use `feature-projects/_feature-project-template/` as a starting point
2. Follow the standard structure (README, business-context, architecture, implementation, validation, tradeoffs)
3. Document all principal engineering decisions
4. Include comprehensive validation and testing
5. Update this file with the new project

## Feature Project Criteria

Feature projects should:
- Solve real-world problems
- Demonstrate multiple engineering domains
- Include production-ready implementations
- Document all tradeoffs and decisions
- Provide comprehensive validation
- Serve as learning resources
