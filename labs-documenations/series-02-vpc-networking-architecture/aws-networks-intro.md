## I'm building a cloud networking architecture

This series documents the design and implementation of a foundational AWS Virtual Private Cloud architecture. The focus is on how core networking constructs are composed to support isolation, routing, and controlled access for cloud workloads.

The work centers on Amazon VPC as the baseline primitive for secure and scalable network design. The architecture is built incrementally to demonstrate how address planning, subnets, routing, and gateways interact to support application deployment and operational requirements.

Cloud networking is treated as an enabling layer for compute and platform services. The intent is to show how network design decisions influence security posture, scalability boundaries, and operational complexity in AWS environments.

Traditional infrastructure models impose cost, maintenance, and scaling constraints. Cloud networking addresses these constraints through software-defined isolation, elastic capacity, and policy-driven control, enabling faster adaptation to changing workload demands.

## Excited to share my progress - build a VPC with me!

This documentation tracks the progression of a VPC build from initial design through functional validation. Each component is introduced based on its role in the overall network topology rather than as an isolated configuration task.

The series is structured to be completed in small, time-bounded increments. Work is broken into discrete units to ensure each architectural decision can be reviewed, validated, and adjusted without introducing unnecessary coupling or rework.

### What are networks?

Networks consist of interconnected systems that exchange data using defined protocols. In cloud environments, networking provides controlled connectivity, shared access to services, predictable data flow, and enforcement points for security and segmentation.

### What is a VPC?

A VPC is a logically isolated virtual network within AWS where resources are deployed with explicitly defined IP ranges, routing behavior, and access controls. It exists to provide isolation, enforce security boundaries, enable custom network topology, and support compliance requirements through deterministic network design.
