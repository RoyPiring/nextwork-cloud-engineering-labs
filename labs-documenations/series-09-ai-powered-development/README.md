# AI-Powered Development Series

**Rank:** 9 (Supporting Feature Project Priority)

This series covers AI-powered development environments and tooling to enhance productivity in cloud engineering work. Demonstrates modern development workflows and developer productivity tools.

## Principal Engineering Story

This series tells the story of enhancing developer productivity through AI-powered tooling following principal engineering methodology. We progress from basic AI-assisted coding to advanced MCP integration, documenting how AI tools integrate into professional development workflows.

### The Journey

**AI IDE (Lab 1):** We explore Cursor IDE, an AI-assisted development environment that enhances code comprehension and feature development.

**AI Code Assistant (Lab 2):** We integrate Claude Code for advanced code generation and review capabilities.

**MCP Integration (Lab 3):** We set up Model Context Protocol (MCP) for enhanced AI tooling integration, enabling AI assistants to interact with development tools and services.

## Learning Path

### 1. AI Workspace: Cursor IDE
**File:** `01-ai-workspace-cursor.md`

**Principal Engineering Focus:** AI-assisted development environment setup

- Cursor IDE installation and configuration
- AI coding assistant features
- Integration with AWS services
- Workflow optimization
- **Decision Point:** AI-assisted IDE vs. traditional IDE tradeoffs

**Prerequisites:** standalone-labs/prerequisite-fundamentals

### 2. AI Workspace: Claude Code
**File:** `02-ai-workspace-claude-code.md`

**Principal Engineering Focus:** Advanced AI code generation and review

- Claude Code setup and configuration
- Code generation and review capabilities
- AWS-specific code assistance
- Best practices and patterns
- **Decision Point:** Multiple AI assistants vs. single tool strategy

**Prerequisites:** Lab 1 (AI workspace setup)

### 3. AI Workspace: MCP Integration
**File:** `03-ai-workspace-mcp.md`

**Principal Engineering Focus:** Model Context Protocol for enhanced AI tooling

- MCP server configuration
- Tool integration patterns
- Database and infrastructure access
- Custom MCP server development
- **Decision Point:** MCP vs. other AI tooling integration approaches

**Prerequisites:** Labs 1-2 (AI workspace setup)
