## Introducing Today's Project!

The solution combines Grafana for visualization, PostgreSQL as the data source, and Docker for isolation and repeatability. Cursor is used as the client interface to interact with the Grafana MCP endpoint. The design focuses on validating end-to-end data flow from source to dashboard, rather than tool proficiency.

Key Tools and Concepts

The system relies on containerized Grafana, a relational database, and SQL-based queries to render dashboards. Core concepts include defining data sources, composing queries, and structuring dashboards to reflect system health and business signals. DBT models are introduced to show the impact of data transformation on query performance and reliability.

### Key tools and concepts



### Challenges and wins

The primary constraint was ensuring correct container configuration and network connectivity between Grafana and PostgreSQL. Successful resolution is measured by stable data ingestion and real-time panel updates in the Grafana UI. The outcome confirms that the visualization layer accurately reflects underlying data changes without manual refresh.

### Why I did this project

The project exists to validate a practical pattern for real-time data visualization using standard open-source components. It demonstrates how dashboards can support operational awareness and decision support when data sources and transformations are clearly defined and validated.

## Connect Cursor to Grafana

This component establishes connectivity between Cursor and the Grafana MCP server running in Docker. The container exposes Grafana over configured ports, enabling external clients to submit queries and render dashboards. The purpose is to confirm that the visualization layer can accept and process incoming data requests.

### Grafana MCP setup

The Grafana MCP configuration defines container runtime parameters, network exposure, and authentication boundaries. Environment variables and port mappings ensure Grafana is reachable while maintaining controlled access. Data sources and dashboards are created within Grafana to provide structured views over incoming data streams.

### Verifying MCP connections

Connection validation is performed by observing active data streams and status indicators in the Grafana UI. Successful verification confirms that data is flowing from Cursor into Grafana without errors, establishing confidence in the end-to-end ingestion path.

## Creating a PostgreSQL Data Source

This step defines PostgreSQL as a Grafana data source, enabling dashboards to query relational data directly. The data source acts as the contract between Grafana and the database, without which dashboards cannot function.

### Data source configuration

The configuration specifies host, database name, and credentials required for access. A successful connection test confirms that Grafana can authenticate to PostgreSQL and execute queries, validating network reachability and permissions.

## Building My First Dashboard

The dashboard aggregates multiple panels to present key metrics, status distributions, and trends. The intent is to provide a consolidated view that surfaces system behavior at a glance while allowing drill-down through targeted queries.

### Dashboard insights

The dashboard includes stat panels for aggregate metrics and bar charts for categorical distributions. This layout supports quick assessment of volume, success rates, and state distribution without requiring direct database access.

### Revenue trends

The time series visualization plots revenue over time to expose variability and directional movement. This panel exists to illustrate how temporal data can be analyzed for trend detection and forecasting support.

## Visualizing the DBT Pipeline

### Building the pipeline dashboard

The pipeline dashboard queries both raw and transformed tables to enable side-by-side comparison. This design highlights differences in query complexity and performance, making the effects of transformation explicit.

### Updating the dashboard

Dashboard updates are performed by modifying SQL queries and panel configurations. Changes propagate immediately, confirming that Grafana reflects the current state of queries and underlying data without redeployment.

### Performance comparison

Panels backed by raw queries exhibit higher execution cost as dataset size grows. Panels using DBT models rely on pre-aggregated, standardized data, reducing load and improving consistency. This distinction matters in production environments where performance, reliability, and data trust are operational requirements.
