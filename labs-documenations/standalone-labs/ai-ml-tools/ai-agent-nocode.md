## Introducing Today's Project!

This project implements an automated workflow that responds to calendar events and applies AI-assisted logic to scheduling actions. The system demonstrates event-driven orchestration, external API integration, and bounded use of an LLM within a workflow engine.

### n8n and workflows

n8n serves as the orchestration layer responsible for triggers, execution flow, and system-to-system coordination. ChatGPT functions as a language processing component, and Google Calendar acts as the system of record. The workflow emphasizes API-driven automation, explicit data flow, and calendar event lifecycle management.

### Tools and Techniques

Services used include n8n for orchestration, ChatGPT for language inference, and Google Calendar for event storage and updates.

Key concepts include workflow automation, no-code and low-code orchestration using n8n, AI integration via ChatGPT, calendar management, and authenticated API interactions.

### Project reflection

The workflow was implemented within a constrained time window. Primary challenges involved configuring ChatGPT API calls within n8n and ensuring consistent execution across dependent services. The final outcome validated that AI-assisted scheduling can be reliably embedded into an automated workflow when scope and boundaries are enforced.

## Exploring n8n

n8n provides a visual execution model for building automated workflows without custom application code. It enables integration between services such as ChatGPT and Google Calendar while maintaining explicit control over triggers, data transformation, and execution order.

### Free trial benefits

The environment was provisioned using an n8n free-tier account. This setup supports prototyping and validation of workflow behavior without requiring payment details or long-term commitment.

## Starting an AI Workflow

The workflow establishes a connection between ChatGPT and Google Calendar to enable automated schedule handling. This configuration defines the baseline for an event-driven calendar management system.

### Configuring workflow triggers

A “New event in Google Calendar” trigger initiates the workflow. Each calendar event generates a new execution, enabling immediate downstream processing. Alternative trigger mechanisms such as scheduled execution or webhooks were available but not used in this implementation.

### Connecting AI agents

The AI agent is implemented as a workflow component rather than an autonomous system. Its role is limited to interpreting inputs and producing structured outputs used by downstream calendar actions.

## Integrating ChatGPT

ChatGPT is integrated to support automated calendar management through n8n. The model processes event context and generates structured text used for scheduling, reminders, and appointment updates.

### Key components of an AI workflow

AI workflow components include:

AI Engine: ChatGPT processes input data and produces calendar-related output.

Data Interface: Google Calendar provides authoritative event data and accepts updates.

Automation Platform: n8n coordinates execution and data exchange between services.

### Choosing the AI model

ChatGPT access is provided through OpenAI. Integration requires an API key, and usage is constrained by service tier limits. Correct credential configuration is mandatory for workflow execution.

## Integrating Google Calendar

The workflow connects to Google Calendar to read and modify calendar events. This integration enables scheduling, updates, and retrieval of event data while maintaining Google Calendar as the authoritative source.

### Understanding tools in AI workflows

n8n is used as the automation platform because it supports application integration, conditional execution, and API-based workflows. This makes it suitable for controlled AI-assisted calendar automation without deploying custom backend services.

### Security considerations for integrations

Google Calendar access is granted through scoped permissions. Requests are reviewed to minimize access, and read-only permissions are preferred where mutation is not required. Credentials are periodically reviewed and revoked if no longer needed.

---

## Testing My Workflow

Workflow logs are analyzed to validate trigger execution and calendar updates. Testing focuses on ensuring that chat-based inputs result in expected workflow behavior and calendar changes.

### Identifying workflow errors

Initial testing produced an “Unable to connect to Google Calendar” error despite prior authorization. This indicated an integration-level issue rather than a logic flaw within the workflow.

### Insights from AI agent logs

Log analysis focused on API disconnects, authentication failures, and rate limits across ChatGPT and Google Calendar. In some cases, the AI agent failed to update events, indicating data transfer or credential issues between components.

## JSON Expressions

Troubleshooting identified an error in the ChatGPT node’s API key configuration. This prevented successful API calls and halted workflow execution until corrected.

### Updating calendar tool expressions

Start and end time expressions were adjusted to account for scheduling dependencies and execution latency. These changes improved sequencing and reduced workflow collisions.

---

## System Messages

System messages define the AI agent’s role, scope, and behavioral constraints for calendar management. Instructions specify permitted actions, boundaries, and expected response structure.

Defined parameters include role definition, scope restrictions, booking boundaries, and example interactions to guide deterministic output.

### Second error!

The workflow successfully scheduled events, but early executions returned incomplete event descriptions. This exposed insufficient constraints in the AI output format.

The AI assistant was restricted to concise, action-oriented responses focused solely on n8n, ChatGPT, and Google Calendar integration.

---

## Success!

The completed workflow parses input data, evaluates scheduling context using ChatGPT, and accurately creates calendar events in Google Calendar. This validates the design of a constrained AI-assisted scheduling workflow.

## Changing My AI Agent's Personality

The agent’s communication behavior was refined through system message updates and prompt constraints. Adjustments focused on structure, context awareness, and predictable output rather than conversational flexibility.

### Workflow improvements

ChatGPT integration was updated to improve response accuracy and execution efficiency. Changes included refined prompt structure, basic error handling, and a simple feedback mechanism.

### Observing agent behavior changes

The agent initially produced overlapping or inconsistent schedules for complex requests. Iterative constraint tuning improved reliability and reduced unintended scheduling behavior.

### System message constraints

Explicit constraints were applied through system messages to restrict output to calendar-related, factual responses. This resulted in more predictable behavior and improved control over AI-assisted scheduling actions.
