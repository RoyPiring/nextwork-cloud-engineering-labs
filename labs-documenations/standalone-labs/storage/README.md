# Storage Labs

Storage fundamentals and patterns for object storage on AWS. These labs can be completed independently or integrated into end-to-end series projects.

## Labs

### 1. Host a Website on Amazon S3
**File:** `aws-host-a-website-on-s3.md`

- S3 bucket creation and configuration
- Static website hosting setup
- Bucket policies and access control
- Public access configuration
- Website endpoint testing
- ACLs and security considerations

### 2. Multi-Cloud Storage
**File:** `aws-multicloud-storage.md`

- Multi-cloud storage strategies
- Cross-cloud data replication
- Storage gateway configuration
- Hybrid cloud storage patterns
- Cost optimization across clouds

## Lab Goals

By completing these labs, you will:
- Configure S3 for static website hosting
- Implement proper access controls for public content
- Design multi-cloud storage architectures
- Optimize storage costs across cloud providers
- Understand storage security best practices

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account Setup (standalone-labs/prerequisite-fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of object storage concepts

## Integration Opportunities

These storage labs support:
- **series-02-vpc-networking-architecture**: S3 networking and VPC endpoints
- **series-01-three-tier-application-architecture**: Integrating storage with applications
- **series-05-cloud-security-identity**: Advanced storage encryption
- **series-06-ai-ml-applications** → **02-ai-rag-series**: Using S3 as knowledge base storage

## Next Steps

After completing these labs, consider:
- **series-02-vpc-networking-architecture** for S3 networking and VPC endpoints
- **series-01-three-tier-application-architecture** for integrating storage with applications
- **series-05-cloud-security-identity** for advanced storage encryption
- **series-06-ai-ml-applications** → **02-ai-rag-series** for using S3 as knowledge base storage
