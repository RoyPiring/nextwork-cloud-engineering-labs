## My AWS Challenge

This document defines a bounded set of introductory AWS projects intended to exercise core cloud concepts. The scope is limited to four discrete projects selected to cover baseline infrastructure, service interaction, and operational patterns without assuming prior context.

### Hold Me Accountable!

The work is constrained to a short execution window to enforce focus and completion discipline. The intent is to validate that each project can be completed end to end with correct configuration, not to optimize for depth or production hardening.

## What is Cloud?

Cloud computing replaces on-premises infrastructure dependency with on-demand access to compute, storage, and networking services. This model shifts responsibility boundaries, reduces capital expenditure, and enables elastic resource consumption aligned to workload demand.

### What is AWS?

Amazon Web Services provides managed infrastructure primitives delivered over the internet, including compute, storage, databases, and networking. These services are commonly used to build, operate, and maintain application platforms across multiple industries and regulatory environments.

Cloud platforms support multiple technical roles, including infrastructure engineering, DevOps, security, and data-focused disciplines. Each role interacts with shared cloud primitives but applies different constraints, controls, and operational priorities.
