## Getting Started With AWS

Setting up the AWS account establishes a billing boundary and identity required to access AWS services. Credit card information is collected to enable billing alerts, fraud prevention, and account verification. No charges occur unless usage exceeds free tier limits or paid services are explicitly consumed.

The initial workload targets a static website hosted on Amazon S3. This establishes a minimal, low-risk environment to validate account access, basic storage configuration, and public content delivery without introducing compute or network complexity.

## AWS Free Tier

The AWS Free Tier provides time-bound and usage-bound access to selected services to support evaluation and experimentation. Upon account creation, the environment includes promotional credits and access to services with defined free usage thresholds across compute, storage, database, and networking categories.

The Free Tier offering consists of promotional credits and a subset of services designated as always-free within specific limits. Credits expire after the defined period or once consumed. Usage outside these limits results in standard billing based on published AWS pricing.

After the Free Tier period ends, the account remains active and retains all configured resources and data. Services that exceed free thresholds or are no longer covered incur charges. Ongoing cost control requires monitoring usage, understanding service limits, and tracking expiration dates within a personal or organizational financial process.
