# Standalone Labs

This folder contains individual labs that are not part of principal engineering series. These labs can be used independently, integrated into other projects, or serve as supporting resources for the series.

## Structure

### Prerequisite Fundamentals
**Path:** `prerequisite-fundamentals/`

Foundation labs required before starting any principal engineering series:
- AWS account setup
- Cloud computing fundamentals
- Beginner challenge framework

**Start here if:** You're new to AWS

### AI/ML Tools
**Path:** `ai-ml-tools/`

Individual AI/ML tools and techniques that can be used independently:
- Amazon Transcribe (speech-to-text)
- AI Agents (no-code and web UI)
- DeepSeek LLM integration
- Prompt Engineering techniques

### Storage
**Path:** `storage/`

Storage fundamentals and patterns:
- S3 static website hosting
- Multi-cloud storage strategies

## Purpose

These labs are:
- **Standalone**: Can be completed independently without following a series
- **Supporting**: Can be integrated into end-to-end series projects
- **Reference**: Serve as quick references for specific tools or patterns

## When to Use

- **Prerequisite Fundamentals**: Required before starting any end-to-end series
- **Other Standalone Labs**: When you need a specific tool or technique without following a full series
- When integrating capabilities into existing projects
- When exploring individual AWS services in isolation
- When building custom solutions that combine multiple standalone labs

## Integration with Principal Engineering Series

These standalone labs complement the principal engineering series:
- **AI/ML Tools** can enhance **series-06-conversational-ai-lex** and **series-07-rag-applications** projects
- **Storage** labs support **series-02-vpc-networking-architecture** and **series-01-three-tier-application-architecture** projects
- All standalone labs can be integrated into **series-03-devops-cicd-automation** for automation

## Next Steps

- Explore individual labs based on your needs
- Integrate tools into end-to-end series projects
- Combine multiple standalone labs for custom solutions
