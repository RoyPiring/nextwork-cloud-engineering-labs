## I'm building a CI/CD pipeline in 7 days

This project builds a CI/CD pipeline over seven days to practice core delivery capabilities: source integration, automated testing, artifact promotion, and controlled deployment. The work produces seven focused implementations that demonstrate repeatable automation, infrastructure-as-code alignment, and delivery workflows used in real cloud environments.

## Hold me accountable!

Execution is limited to a fixed 60-minute daily window over seven consecutive days to enforce scope discipline. Progress is tracked externally to ensure completion. After the pipeline is complete, the work extends into Kubernetes and cloud infrastructure automation to address platform-level delivery concerns.

### What is DevOps?

DevOps is an operating model that treats software delivery and system reliability as a single responsibility. It relies on automation for provisioning, deployment, and testing, and embeds monitoring, incident response, and security controls directly into the delivery lifecycle.

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD is an automated delivery system that controls how code moves from commit to deployment. It standardizes integration, testing, and release steps to reduce human error, shorten feedback loops, detect defects early, and coordinate work across development, operations, and security teams.
