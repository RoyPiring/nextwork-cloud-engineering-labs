## Introducing Today's Project!

This project implements a serverless REST API using AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway. The system exposes an HTTP interface that invokes Lambda functions on demand and integrates with DynamoDB for data retrieval. The objective is to demonstrate an event-driven API architecture that minimizes infrastructure management while supporting horizontal scalability and usage-based cost control.

### Tools and concepts

The system is composed of AWS Lambda for compute execution, Amazon API Gateway for request routing and API management, and Amazon DynamoDB for persistent storage. The architecture relies on serverless execution, REST-based resource modeling, and event-driven invocation. Deployment stages are used to isolate environments and manage API lifecycle and exposure.

### Project reflection

The implementation focused on integrating API Gateway with DynamoDB through Lambda while maintaining correct request handling and access configuration. The primary engineering concern was ensuring the API Gateway method integration and Lambda execution role permissions aligned with DynamoDB access requirements. 

The completed system validates that the API functions correctly without pre-provisioned servers and scales based on request volume.

## Lambda functions

AWS Lambda provides the execution layer for the API business logic. The Lambda function processes incoming API Gateway events, performs read operations against DynamoDB, and constructs structured JSON responses.

The function handles HTTP GET requests for the /items resource and returns a normalized response containing item identifiers and attributes retrieved from the database.

## API Gateway

Amazon API Gateway serves as the external interface for the system. It terminates client HTTP requests, maps methods and resource paths to the appropriate Lambda function, and returns responses to callers

. The API is implemented using a RESTful model to support predictable resource access and standard HTTP semantics. API Gateway manages request routing, stage-based URLs, and operational visibility.

Client requests are received by API Gateway and matched to a resource path and HTTP method. API Gateway invokes the associated Lambda function with the request context and payload. The Lambda function executes application logic, interacts with DynamoDB, and returns a response object. API Gateway then transforms and forwards the response to the client.

## API Resources and Methods

API resources represent discrete data entities exposed by the service. Each resource is accessed through defined HTTP methods that control the permitted operations.

The implementation uses GET methods to retrieve data from DynamoDB via Lambda. Resource paths uniquely identify data endpoints and enforce a consistent access pattern for clients.

The deployed API demonstrates a fully serverless design using managed AWS services. Lambda encapsulates application logic, API Gateway handles request routing and exposure, and DynamoDB provides a scalable data store. The system processes GET requests to the /items endpoint and returns structured JSON responses derived from database records.

## API Deployment

API Gateway stages are used to represent separate deployment environments. Each stage provides an isolated URL and configuration context. The API was deployed to a development stage for validation and a production stage for external access. Stage separation enables controlled promotion of changes and independent testing without impacting production consumers.

Access to the API requires the stage-specific invoke URL generated by API Gateway. Requests sent to the production stage URL are routed to the active Lambda integration. Without the correct stage URL, the API cannot be invoked, and requests will fail at the entry point.

## API Documentation

API documentation defines how consumers interact with the service. It describes available endpoints, supported methods, request and response formats, authentication expectations, and error conditions. Documentation is published per API Gateway stage to align with deployed environments and ensure consumers reference the correct interface version.

Publishing documentation binds it to a specific API stage. Each stage represents a distinct deployment context with its own URL and configuration.

This approach supports versioning, controlled rollout, and environment-specific visibility. The published documentation provides a complete technical reference for developers integrating with the API.
